* Panasonic AN30259A 3-channel LED driver

The AN30259A is a LED controller capable of driving three LEDs independently. It supports
constant current output and sloping current output modes. The chip is connected over I2C.

Required properties:
	- compatible : must be "panasonic,an30259a"
	- reg -  I2C slave address

Each led is represented as a sub-node of the panasonic,an30259a node.

Optional sub-node properties:
	- label: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
	- linux,default-trigger: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/leds/common.txt
    - led-sources: 0 if LED is connected to LED1 pin,
      1 if LED is connected to LED2 pin, or 2 if LED is connected to LED3 pin.

Example:
    an30259a@30 {
        compatible = "panasonic,an30259a";
        reg = <0x30>;

        red {
            led-sources = <0>;
            linux,default-trigger = "heartbeat";
            label = "red";
        };

        green {
            led-sources = <1>;
            label = "green";
        };

        blue {
            led-sources = <2>;
            label = "blue";
        };
    };
